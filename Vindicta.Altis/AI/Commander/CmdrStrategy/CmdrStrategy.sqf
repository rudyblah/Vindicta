Class: AI.CmdrAI.CmdrStrategy.CmdrStrategy

Base class for command strategy implementations.

Acts as a customization entry point for driving commander behaviour to achieve
specific gameplay.
e.g If you want to change the criteria the commander will use to decide 
when to occupy a specific location then you can derive a custom `CmdrStrategy`
and override `getLocationDesirability` (or modify the `takeLoc*` member values).
