// Enum: AI.CmdrAI.CmdrAction.CMDR_ACTION_STATE

// <ActionStateTransitions> are used by <CmdrAction> to transition between these states.

// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_NONE - Indicates no change to the current state, return from 
// <ActionStateTransition.update> when the update didn't cause a state change, e.g. on a long running
// AST that is currently in progress but not yet finished, like a garrison move or wait.

// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_START - Indicates the final state of a CmdrAction, once it is completed 
// (successfully or not). The any final ASTs should transition TO this state.

// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_END - Indicates the final state of a CmdrAction, once it is completed 
// (successfully or not). The any final ASTs should transition TO this state.

// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_ALL - Used in places to indicate that ALL states are being considered 
// (in whatever context that makes sense).

// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_CUSTOM - Lowest value for custom states, as seen below.
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_SPLIT - After a garrison is split into tw
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_READY_TO_MOVE - When a garrison is ready toove
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_MOVED - After a garrison has completed a mo
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_TARGET_DEAD - When a target is dead, could beuccess or failure state depending on the context (e.g. kill or join)
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_ARRIVED - When a garrison has arrived somwher
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_ASSIGNED - When a garrison has been assigd an action
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_RTB - When a garrison should return to ba
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_RTB_SUCCESS - After a garrison has successfully returned to ba
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_RTB_SELECT_TARGET - When a garrison needs to select a target for R
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_FAILED_OUT_OF_RANGE - When an AST fails due to an out of rnge errorof some kind
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_FAILED_GARRISON_DEAD - When as AST fails due to a garrisoneing dead
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_FAILED_TIMEOUT - When an AST fails due to a generic time o
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_NEXT_WAYPOINT - When the next waypoint in a route should be selcted
// CMDR_ACTION_STATE_FINISHED_WAYPOINTS - When there are no more waypoints in a route

// Class: AI.CmdrAI.CmdrAction.AST_VAR
// ActionStateTransition variables.
// These are wrappers for variables so the value can be shared between multiple ActionStateTransitions.
// e.g. An output of one AST can be the input of another (such as the first AST selecting a target and the next 
// AST giving a move order to the target), so the same AST_VAR can be assigned to both. When the first AST
// writes a value to the AST_VAR the other AST sees that change to its input immediately as they 
// both refer to the same underlying value. 
// They also allow the CmdrAction state to be pushed/popped during simulation so that real world actions 
// are not effected.
